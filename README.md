# Customer Churn Prediction for Subscription Services

### Overview
Customer churn is the tendency of customers to discontinue being clients of a specific company, particularly a subscription firm. Customer subscription data, including usage patterns, payment history, demographics, and churn status. The purpose of this project concerning a total of 21 features ranging from demographic, billing data, usage pattern, to relationships is to provide a thorough analysis using a variety of algorithms, before finally comparing the prediction results to find which one of the algorithms provides the best prediction results.

### Objectives
1.To identify the best performing models to predict customer churn subscription

2.The risk of customers canceling their subscriptions and implement target retention strategies

### Technology used
1.Python

2.Numpy

3.Seaborn

4.SKlearn

5.Matplotlib

### Summary
The following is an overview of the different machine learning models that were trained and assessed to forecast customer attrition using the above code snippets:

Overall, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy among the models tested, indicating its effectiveness in predicting customer churn in the given dataset. However, further analysis of other metrics provided in the classification reports, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation of each model's performance. Additionally, techniques like SMOTE were employed to address class imbalance, contributing to improved model performance.

Here are some suggestions derived from the examination of the machine learning models used to forecast customer churn: 

1. Random Forest Classifier: Out of all the models that were examined, the Random Forest classifier consistently showed the highest accuracy. As a result, it is advised to use the Random Forest model as your main model for churn prediction

Data Preprocessing: - Imbalanced Address Class imbalance was corrected utilizing SMOTE approaches, which enhanced the performance of models such as Gradient Boosting. Preprocessing the data is critical for effectively dealing with class imbalance and ensuring robust model performance. 
3. Model Evaluation: - Classification reports can help you understand model performance beyond accuracy. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score give a more complete picture of a model's capacity to reliably anticipate churn.

4. Additional Experimentation: - Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust all models' hyperparameters to maximize their performance. Methods such as random search and grid search can be used to do this. - Ensemble approaches*: To combine the advantages of several models and possibly improve predictive performance, investigate ensemble approaches like model stacking or boosting.

5. Deployment and Monitoring: - Use the Random Forest model that was selected to predict customer turnover in real time by deploying it into production. - *Continuous Monitoring: To keep the deployed model's efficacy up to date, retrain it with fresh data on a regular basis.

6. Interpretability and Explainability: - Random Forest models have a higher interpretability than some other sophisticated models. Consider explaining model predictions to stakeholders to boost trust and comprehension of the model's decisions. 7. Documentation and Collaboration: - Documentation: Document the machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing procedures, model selection criteria, and evaluation metrics, for reproducibility and team collaboration. - Knowledge sharing: Share the analysis's insights and conclusions with key stakeholders to help guide corporate decisions and strategies for customer retention and satisfaction.

By implementing these suggestions, businesses can develop strong and accurate machine learning models for anticipating customer churn, which will increase customer retention and boost overall profitability
